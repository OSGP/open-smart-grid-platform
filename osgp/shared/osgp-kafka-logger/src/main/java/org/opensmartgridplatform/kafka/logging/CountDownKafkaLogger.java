/**
 * KafkaLogger implementation that can be used in tests to verify it is called,
 * and only called with some expected value in the consumer record.
 * <p>
 * A typical way to use it, is to create the following beans in the Spring test
 * context:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>a bean containing the expected value
 * <li>a bean containing a count down latch with the number of times the log
 * method should be called (typically once)
 * <li>a bean with this implementation as the KafkaLogger, taking in the bean
 * values of the count down latch and expected value as parameters
 * </ul>
 *
 * The test case can auto-wire the count down latch and the expected value.<br>
 * The expected value can be used by a test producer to send it to the topic for
 * the consumer.<br>
 * The count down latch can be used to assert that the KafkaLogger was called
 * with the expected value by awaiting the count down to zero.
