@Microgrids @Platform
Feature: Core Operations, DeviceLifeCycle
  As a grid operator
  I want to distinguish the various statuses of a device
  So I know what I can or cannot do with the device

  Scenario Outline: Set rtu device status
    Given an rtu iec61850 device
      | DeviceIdentification | RTU10001 |
    When a SetDeviceLifecycleStatus request is received
      | DeviceIdentification  | RTU10001 |
      | DeviceLifecycleStatus | <Status> |
    Then the device lifecycle status in the database is
      | DeviceIdentification  | RTU10001 |
      | DeviceLifecycleStatus | <Status> |

    Examples: 
      | Status                |
      | NEW_IN_INVENTORY      |
      | READY_FOR_USE         |
      | REGISTERED            |
      | IN_USE                |
      | RETURNED_TO_INVENTORY |
      | UNDER_TEST            |
      | DESTROYED             |
