Feature: Microgrids Get Data Alternative Scenarios
  In order to make OSGP more robust
  As an OSGP client
  I want to properly handle alternative or wrong configurations and get data failures

  @Iec61850MockServerPampus
  Scenario: Request PV1 Health for a non-existing logical device
    Given an rtu iec61850 device
      | DeviceIdentification | RTU-PAMPUS |
      | Port                 |      62102 |
    When a get data request is received

      | NumberOfMeasurements_1    |          1 |
      | MeasurementFilterNode_1_1 | Health     |
    Then a SOAP fault should be returned
      | DeviceIdentification | RTU-PAMPUS                   |
      | Component            | PROTOCOL_IEC61850            |
      | Message              | FcModelNode with objectReference WAGO61850ServerPV4/LLN0.Health does not exist |

  @Iec61850MockServerWago
  Scenario: Request PV1 Health not default servername
    Given an rtu iec61850 device
      | DeviceIdentification | RTU-WAGO    |
      | ServerName           | WAGO123     |

      | Port                 |       62105 |
    And the WAGO RTU returning
      | PV1 | LLN0.Health.stVal |        3 |
      | PV1 | LLN0.Health.q     | OLD_DATA |
    When a get data request is received

      | NumberOfMeasurements_1    |        1 |
      | MeasurementFilterNode_1_1 | Health   |
    Then the get data response should be returned
      | DeviceIdentification     | RTU-WAGO |
      | Result                   | OK       |
      | NumberOfSystems          |        1 |
