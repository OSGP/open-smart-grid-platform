Feature: SmartMetering Installation - Decouple M-Bus Device
  As a grid operator
  I want to be able to decouple an M-Bus device from a smart meter

  Scenario: DeCouple G-meter from E-meter
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |
    And a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification        | TESTG102400000001 |
      | DeviceType                  | SMART_METER_G     |
      | GatewayDeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | Channel                     |                 1 |
    When the DeCouple G-meter "TESTG102400000001" from E-meter "TEST1024000000001" request is received
    Then the DeCouple response is "OK"
    And the G-meter "TESTG102400000001" is DeCoupled from device "TEST1024000000001"
    And the channel of device "TESTG102400000001" is cleared

  Scenario: DeCouple unknown G-meter from E-meter
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |
    When the DeCouple G-meter "TESTunknownDevice" from E-meter "TEST1024000000001" request is received
    Then retrieving the DeCouple response results in an exception
    And a SOAP fault should have been returned
      | Code    |            201 |
      | Message | UNKNOWN_DEVICE |

  Scenario: DeCouple G-meter from unknown E-meter
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TESTG102400000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_G     |
    When the DeCouple G-meter "TESTG102400000001" from E-meter "TEST102400unknown" request is received for an unknown gateway
    Then a SOAP fault should have been returned
      | Code    |            201 |
      | Message | UNKNOWN_DEVICE |

  Scenario: DeCouple inactive G-meter from E-meter
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |
    And a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification        | TESTG102400000001 |
      | DeviceType                  | SMART_METER_G     |
      | GatewayDeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | Channel                     |                 1 |
      | DeviceLifecycleStatus       | NEW_IN_INVENTORY  |
    When the DeCouple G-meter "TESTG102400000001" from E-meter "TEST1024000000001" request is received
    Then retrieving the DeCouple response results in an exception
    And a SOAP fault should have been returned
      | Code    |             207 |
      | Message | INACTIVE_DEVICE |
