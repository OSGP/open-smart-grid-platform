Feature: SmartMetering Bundle - GetOutages
  As a grid operator 
  I want to retrieve the power outages from a meter via a bundle request

  Background: 
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |

  Scenario: Retrieve power outages of a device in a bundle request
    Given a bundle request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    And the bundle request contains a get outages action
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a get outages response with 4 outages
