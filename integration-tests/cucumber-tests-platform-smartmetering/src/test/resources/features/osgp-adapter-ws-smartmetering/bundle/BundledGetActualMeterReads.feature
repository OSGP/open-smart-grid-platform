Feature: SmartMetering Bundle - GetActualMeterReads
  As a grid operator 
  I want to be able to get actual meter reads from a meter via a bundle request

  @DSMR22
  Scenario Outline: Get actual meter reads of a device (<protocol> <protocolversion>) in a bundle request
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | <deviceIdentification> |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E          |
      | Protocol             | <protocol>             |
      | ProtocolVersion      | <protocolversion>      |
      | Lls1active           | <lls1active>           |
      | Hls5active           | <hls5active>           |
    And a bundle request
      | DeviceIdentification | <deviceIdentification> |
    And the bundle request contains a get actual meter reads action
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a get actual meter reads response

    Examples:
      | deviceIdentification | protocol | protocolversion | lls1active | hls5active |
      | TEST1024000000001    | DSMR     | 4.2.2           | false      | true       |
      | KTEST10260000001     | DSMR     | 2.2             | true       | false      |
      | ZTEST10260000001     | DSMR     | 2.2             | true       | false      |

    And the bundle request contains a get actual meter reads gas action
      | DeviceIdentification | <deviceIdentification> |

      # identification for device with protocol DSMR 2.2 has only 16 positions (E-meter) or start with a number (G-meter)
      | TEST102600000001            | 2TEST102600000001    | DSMR     | 2.2             | true       | false      |

  Scenario: Get actual meter reads of E and G of a device in a bundle request
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |

    And the bundle request contains a get actual meter reads gas action
      | DeviceIdentification | TESTG102400000001 |
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a get actual meter reads response
    Then the bundle response should contain a get actual meter reads gas response

  Scenario: Invalid g meter configuration
