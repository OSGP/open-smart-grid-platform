Feature: SmartMetering Bundle - GetPowerQualityProfile
  As a grid operator
  I want to be able to retrieve power quality profile data from a meter via a bundle request

  Background: 
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification      | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType                | SMART_METER_E     |
      | Protocol                  | DSMR              |
      | ProtocolVersion           | 4.2.2             |
      | Port                      | 1024              |
      | FirmwareModuleVersionComm | V 1.1             |
      | FirmwareModuleVersionMa   | V 1.2             |
      | FirmwareModuleVersionFunc | V 1.3             |

  Scenario: Retrieve power quality profile data as part of a bundled request
    Given a bundle request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001   |
    And the bundle request contains a get power quality profile request with parameters
      | ProfileType          |              PUBLIC |
      | BeginDate            | 2015-01-01 00:00:00 |
      | EndDate              | 2017-01-10 00:00:00 |
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a power quality profile response with values
      | DeviceIdentification           | TEST1024000000001 |
      | NumberOfCaptureObjects         |                 4 |
