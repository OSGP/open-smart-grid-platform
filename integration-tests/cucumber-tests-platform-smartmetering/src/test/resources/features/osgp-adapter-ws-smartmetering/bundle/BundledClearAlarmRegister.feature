Feature: SmartMetering Bundle - ClearAlarmRegister
  As a grid operator 
  I want to be able to clear the alarm register from a meter via a bundle request

  Scenario: Clear alarm register with SMR 5.1
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification     | TEST1028000000002 |
      | DeviceType               | SMART_METER_E     |
      | SelectiveAccessSupported | true              |
      | Protocol                 | SMR               |
      | ProtocolVersion          | 5.1               |
    And device "TEST1028000000002" has alarm register "1" with some value
    And a bundle request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1028000000002 |
    And the bundle request contains a clear alarm register action
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a clear alarm register response
    And alarm register "1" of device "TEST1028000000002" has been cleared

  Scenario: Clear both alarm registers with SMR 5.2
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification     | TEST1029000000001 |
      | DeviceType               | SMART_METER_E     |
      | SelectiveAccessSupported | true              |
      | Protocol                 | SMR               |
      | ProtocolVersion          | 5.2               |
      | Port                     |              1029 |
    And device "TEST1029000000001" has alarm register "1" with some value
    And device "TEST1029000000001" has alarm register "2" with some value
    And a bundle request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1029000000001 |
    And the bundle request contains a clear alarm register action
    When the bundle request is received
    Then the bundle response should contain a clear alarm register response
    And alarm register "1" of device "TEST1029000000001" has been cleared
    And alarm register "2" of device "TEST1029000000001" has been cleared
