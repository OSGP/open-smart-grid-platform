Feature: SmartMetering Connection security
  As a grid operator
  I want to communicate with devices at different levels of security
  So the transferred data is as secure as possible

  # Needs a DlmsDevice simulator with security level 1 on port 1026
  Scenario: Communicate with LLS1 without sn and hdlc with simulator supporting encrypted communication
    Given a dlms device

      | Port                 |              1026 |
    When the get actual meter reads request is received
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1026000000001 |
    Then the actual meter reads result should be returned
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1026000000001 |
