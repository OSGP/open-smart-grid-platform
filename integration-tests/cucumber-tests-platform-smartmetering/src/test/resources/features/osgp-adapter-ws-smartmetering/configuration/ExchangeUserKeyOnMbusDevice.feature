Feature: SmartMetering Configuration - Exchange User Key on M-Bus Device
  As a grid operator
  I want to be able to exchange the user key on an M-Bus device coupled on a device
  In order to setup secure communications between the M-Bus device and the host

  Background: 
    Given a dlms device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | DeviceType           | SMART_METER_E     |
    And a dlms device

  # This test runs mostly OK in isolation. However, when run with other tests it fails.
  # Somehow the M-Bus User key is stored in the database, but is not seen in the device
  # as it is inspected in Then-step: "a valid m-bus user key is stored".
