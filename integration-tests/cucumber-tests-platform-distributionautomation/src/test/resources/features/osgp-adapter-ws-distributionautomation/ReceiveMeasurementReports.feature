Feature: DistributionAutomation Receive measurement reports
  As a grid operator
  I want to receive measurement reports from an IEC 60870 device
  So I get updates about the current state of the device

  Scenario: Connect to an IEC 60870 device
    Given an IEC 60870 RTU
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | Status               | Active            |
      | Port                 |             62404 |
      | CommonAddress        |                75 |
    When Organization test-org connects to device TEST1024000000001
    Then I get a measurement report for device TEST1024000000001

  Scenario: Connect to another IEC 60870 device
    Given an IEC 60870 RTU
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000002 |
      | Status               | Active            |
      | Port                 |             62404 |
      | CommonAddress        |                75 |
    When Organization test-org connects to device TEST1024000000002
    Then I get a measurement report for device TEST1024000000002
