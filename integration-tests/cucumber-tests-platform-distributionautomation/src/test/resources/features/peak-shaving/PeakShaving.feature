Feature: Peak shaving

  Scenario: Get Ls Peak shaving message from MQTT device
    Given an MQTT device
      | DeviceIdentification | TST-01             |
      | IntegrationType      | Kafka              |
      | MqttTopic            | TST-01/measurement |
    When MQTT device "TST-01" sends a measurement report
      | payload | [{"gisnr":"TST-01-L-1V1", "feeder":"8", "D": "2020-08-29 09:00:00", "data": [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8,1.9,2.0,2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4,2.5,2.6,2.7,2.8,2.9,3.0,3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8,3.9,4.0,4.1]}] |
    Then a message is published to Kafka
