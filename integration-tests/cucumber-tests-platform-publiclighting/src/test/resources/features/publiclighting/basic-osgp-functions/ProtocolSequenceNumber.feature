  Scenario Outline: Valid sequence number ranges platform initiates communication
    Given an ssld oslp device
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | Protocol             | <Protocol>        |
    And the device returns a get status response "OK" over "<Protocol>"
      | PreferredLinkType  | LINK_NOT_SET |
      | ActualLinkType     | LINK_NOT_SET |
      | LightType          | LT_NOT_SET   |
      | EventNotifications |              |
      | LightValues        | 1,true,100;  |
    And the device adds "<AddNumberToSequenceNumber>" to the sequencenumber in the "<Protocol>" response
    When receiving a get status request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the get status async response contains
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    And a get status "<Protocol>" message is sent to device "TEST1024000000001"
    And the platform buffers a get status response message for device "TEST1024000000001"
      | Result | OK |

    Examples: 
      | Protocol    | AddNumberToSequenceNumber |
      | OSLP ELSTER |                        -5 |
      | OSLP ELSTER |                        -4 |
