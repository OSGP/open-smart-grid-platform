      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
      | Protocol             | <Protocol>        |
    And the device returns a stop device response "OK" over "<Protocol>"
    When receiving a stop device test request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the stop device async response contains
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    And a stop device "<Protocol>" message is sent to device "TEST1024000000001"
    And the platform buffers a stop device response message for device "TEST1024000000001"
