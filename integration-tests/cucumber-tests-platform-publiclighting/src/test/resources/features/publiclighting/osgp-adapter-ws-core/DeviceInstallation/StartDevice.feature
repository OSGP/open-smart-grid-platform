  Scenario Outline: Start an ssld device
    Given an ssld oslp device
      | DeviceIdentification       | TEST1024000000001 |
      | OrganizationIdentification | test-org          |
      | Protocol                   | <Protocol>        |
    And the device returns a start device response "OK" over "<Protocol>"
    When receiving a start device request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the start device async response contains
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    And a start device "<Protocol>" message is sent to device "TEST1024000000001"
    And the platform buffers a start device response message for device "TEST1024000000001"
      | Result | OK |

    Examples:
      | Protocol    |
      | OSLP ELSTER |

  Scenario Outline: Start device with incorrect parameters
    Given an ssld device
      | DeviceIdentification       | TEST1024000000001            |
      | OrganizationIdentification | <OrganizationIdentification> |
      | Status                     | unknown                      |
    When receiving a start device request
      | DeviceIdentification | TEST1024000000001 |
    Then the start device response contains soap fault
      | Message | UNAUTHORIZED |

    Examples:
      | OrganizationIdentification |
      | ORGANIZATION-01            |
